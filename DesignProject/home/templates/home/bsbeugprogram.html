            <p> Every life form, beginning from microscopic bacteria to multicellular organisms, can be considered as a system that has been perfected over millennia by Evolution. Beginning from thermodynamically efficient cellular processes to the molecular motors driving the bacterial flagella, each product of evolution is an optimized engineering design that can be translated into real-life applications across disciplines. Today’s interdisciplinary biology is well complemented by engineering domains including electronics, computer science, mechanics, and materials engineering.  Computational biology, for example, permits solving biology problems using statistical, artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. Extensive use of computational biology is essential in data-driven approaches including Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics, and Metabolomics. This amalgamation of biology and computer science has transformed the landscape of the infectious and non-infectious diseases research allowing the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Today’s disease diagnosis is much more specific and sensitive, thanks to biosensors, which have far-reaching applications not only in healthcare but also in the environment, energy, and agriculture. Some applications include in-situ biosensors for human biochemical parameters, environmental contaminants, soil moisture, soil physicochemical parameters, etc. Advances in Biology have not only permitted the early diagnosis of disease but have also contributed abundantly to therapeutic interventions. It is now possible to intervene in diseases taking a multi-pronged approach, including the development of new drugs; production of recombinant therapeutics; development of implantable sensors, control systems; and editing genetic defects. Similarly, synthetic biology and genome editing tools have enabled the development of industrially important organisms for biofuel production as well as environmental remediation. Together, these technologies have significantly contributed to extending the healthy lifespan of the human race and have shown promise towards food, water, and energy security. In other words, bioengineering as a discipline has evolved to a great extent in last couple of decades and now demands a different intellectual outlook and scientific understanding for its further study.  Therefore, an undergraduate academic program in Bioengineering should reflect this rapid evolution of the discipline, underlying scientific and technological advancements and interdisciplinary cross-talk so as to capture the mind of the next generation.

The Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur is committed to achieving excellence in shaping the young minds of tomorrow with a unique blend of teaching techniques and hands-on research-based learning. The Institute works towards the holistic development of students allowing them to be able to assume leadership positions in Industry, Academia, and Entrepreneurial ventures. The Department of Bioscience & Bioengineering is committed to this goal and has developed academic programs that are interdisciplinary in nature and include a substantial component of courses from other science and engineering Departments. The Department aspires to produce Graduates, who can develop solutions to tackle local and global problems related to healthcare, energy, environment, water, and food.
