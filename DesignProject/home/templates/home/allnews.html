                                <b>An Interactive session:</b> The objective of this activity is to promote the learning of current trending topics of computer science. The participants will be taught about the basics of different computing domains by the respective experts in the domain. The domain topics are from various technologies which are hot topics in the industries. The difficulty level of the topics will be of three stages such as beginner stage, advanced stage and expert stage. Every domain will be well-taught through presentations and discussions over practical examples, which includes what the domain is? Where does it get you? How should you start with? etc., followed by a question and answer session in which the mentors cleared all the doubts of the attendees. Once all the domains are covered, there will be an interactive session among the mentors and the attendees for an unconfined exchange of views so that the beginners can learn about the latest updates in their particular interests.
